As deemed \nappropriate by the program faculty, a rubric may be used to judge proﬁciency of these defenses.\n3. DISSERTATION \nAfter the dissertation proposal and IRB are approved, the doctoral student is permitted to begin \ncollecting data proposed in the dissertation proposal. All students must enroll in a total of 12 units of \ndissertation credit during the ﬁnal year of the program — 6 credits in fall semester and 6 credits in the \nspring semester of year 3 of the program.

When is the literature review milestone completed during the doctoral program?,"[""During the 3rd summer of the program, students complete the required courses, and at the same \ntime continue work on the dissertation proposal + IRB.  \n1. LITERATURE REVIEW + CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK \nA preliminary literature review is required of each doctoral student during the 2nd summer of the \ndoctoral program. The faculty member teaching the 2nd Proseminar (EDD 591B) will require the \nliterature review as part of the course requirements. The literature review milestone is deﬁned as an \nintegrative review of literature that cuts across individual courses and is based on a student’s \nparticular area of interest and research. It is expected that the literature review will include a 25-30 \npage review of relevant literature, followed by 3-5 page description of the research methods \nanticipated for answering the proposed questions. The student’s advisor will also review student \nperformance on the literature review, which is graded on a pass/fail basis. Successful completion of \nthe literature review is required for the student to continue courses and to move to the next phase of \nthe program, the dissertation proposal.\n    \n2. DISSERTATION PROPOSAL & IRB\nFollowing the literature review milestone and the required coursework, each student is expected to \ncomplete a dissertation proposal and formally present the proposal to his/her doctoral committee, \nincluding the chair, another member of the SJSU faculty, and third member of the committee \nselected from the ﬁeld in which the student works. It is expected that all committee members will \nhave a terminal degree.\nThe traditional dissertation proposal consists of a draft of the introduction, preliminary literature \nreview, and methodology and references. The proposal informs committee members of tentative \nresearch plans. The student is also required to submit a separate application based on the research \nproposal to the University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) based on the actual research proposed \nin the study and proposed data collection activities. The data collection phase cannot be formally \nstarted until IRB application is approved. \nApproval of the dissertation proposal requires a formal meeting of the candidate and dissertation \ncommittee, in which the student presents his/her proposal and receives feedback. In order to move \nforward, the Dissertation Committee must formally (in writing) approve for the dissertation proposal \nand its willingness to support student’s movement to accomplish the research proposed. While \nsuggestions for improving the proposal are typical, the committee must ultimately decide if the \nproposal is sufﬁciently developed as a roadmap of what is to be accomplished in the dissertation \nresearch. At this stage, the Committee has three options: 1) to approve the student moving forward \nto the dissertation; 2) to approve the student moving forward with revisions as stated in the approval; \nand 3) to require that the student submit a revised dissertation proposal at a separate meeting of the \ndissertation committee.

Successful completion of the dissertation proposal is required for a student to move to the \nnext phase of the program, the dissertation. \nOral Defense of Dissertation Proposal and Dissertation\nThe Dissertation Committee provides guidance to the candidate, is responsible for approving the \nﬁnal written dissertation and oral defense, and for assuring dissertation conformance with program \nrequirements and rigorous research expectations as established by the College Doctoral Faculty, the \nUniversity Graduate Council, and Graduate School.\nBoth the preliminary defense of the proposal and ﬁnal defense of the dissertation provide a \nmechanism for the faculty to assess oral expression, mastery of advanced disciplinary knowledge, \nDISSERTATION \nPROCESS: 3 STEPS\n6"", ""During the 3rd summer of the program, students complete the required courses, and at the same \ntime continue work on the dissertation proposal + IRB.  \n1.

What is the role of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in the dissertation process?,"[""During the 3rd summer of the program, students complete the required courses, and at the same \ntime continue work on the dissertation proposal + IRB.  \n1. LITERATURE REVIEW + CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK \nA preliminary literature review is required of each doctoral student during the 2nd summer of the \ndoctoral program. The faculty member teaching the 2nd Proseminar (EDD 591B) will require the \nliterature review as part of the course requirements. The literature review milestone is deﬁned as an \nintegrative review of literature that cuts across individual courses and is based on a student’s \nparticular area of interest and research. It is expected that the literature review will include a 25-30 \npage review of relevant literature, followed by 3-5 page description of the research methods \nanticipated for answering the proposed questions. The student’s advisor will also review student \nperformance on the literature review, which is graded on a pass/fail basis. Successful completion of \nthe literature review is required for the student to continue courses and to move to the next phase of \nthe program, the dissertation proposal.\n    \n2. DISSERTATION PROPOSAL & IRB\nFollowing the literature review milestone and the required coursework, each student is expected to \ncomplete a dissertation proposal and formally present the proposal to his/her doctoral committee, \nincluding the chair, another member of the SJSU faculty, and third member of the committee \nselected from the ﬁeld in which the student works. It is expected that all committee members will \nhave a terminal degree.\nThe traditional dissertation proposal consists of a draft of the introduction, preliminary literature \nreview, and methodology and references. The proposal informs committee members of tentative \nresearch plans. The student is also required to submit a separate application based on the research \nproposal to the University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) based on the actual research proposed \nin the study and proposed data collection activities. The data collection phase cannot be formally \nstarted until IRB application is approved. \nApproval of the dissertation proposal requires a formal meeting of the candidate and dissertation \ncommittee, in which the student presents his/her proposal and receives feedback. In order to move \nforward, the Dissertation Committee must formally (in writing) approve for the dissertation proposal \nand its willingness to support student’s movement to accomplish the research proposed. While \nsuggestions for improving the proposal are typical, the committee must ultimately decide if the \nproposal is sufﬁciently developed as a roadmap of what is to be accomplished in the dissertation \nresearch. At this stage, the Committee has three options: 1) to approve the student moving forward \nto the dissertation; 2) to approve the student moving forward with revisions as stated in the approval; \nand 3) to require that the student submit a revised dissertation proposal at a separate meeting of the \ndissertation committee. All students will have two chances to successfully defend the dissertation \nproposal. Successful completion of the dissertation proposal is required for a student to move to the \nnext phase of the program, the dissertation. \nOral Defense of Dissertation Proposal and Dissertation\nThe Dissertation Committee provides guidance to the candidate, is responsible for approving the \nﬁnal written dissertation and oral defense, and for assuring dissertation conformance with program \nrequirements and rigorous research expectations as established by the College Doctoral Faculty, the \nUniversity Graduate Council, and Graduate School.\nBoth the preliminary defense of the proposal and ﬁnal defense of the dissertation provide a \nmechanism for the faculty to assess oral expression, mastery of advanced disciplinary knowledge, \nDISSERTATION \nPROCESS: 3 STEPS\n6"", ""During the 3rd summer of the program, students complete the required courses, and at the same \ntime continue work on the dissertation proposal + IRB.  \n1.

As deemed \nappropriate by the program faculty, a rubric may be used to judge proﬁciency of these defenses.\n3. DISSERTATION \nAfter the dissertation proposal and IRB are approved, the doctoral student is permitted to begin \ncollecting data proposed in the dissertation proposal. All students must enroll in a total of 12 units of \ndissertation credit during the ﬁnal year of the program — 6 credits in fall semester and 6 credits in the \nspring semester of year 3 of the program. Once the candidate has enrolled in 12 dissertation units, \nthe maximum allowable, continuous enrollment must be maintained until the dissertation is approved \nand ﬁled.  \nDescription of the Dissertation \nThe traditional dissertation consists of ﬁve chapters or sections: 1) introduction, 2) literature review, \n3) methodology, 4) results/analysis, and 5) conclusions/recommendations. This is typically followed \nby a references section and relevant appendices. The Lurie College of Education uses APA style for \nresearch and the SJSU Graduate Studies division provides additional formatting/style guidelines for \ntheses and dissertations.  \nThere are currently many initiatives across the country which reference new strategies and \napproaches for the doctoral dissertation in the Ed.D. program. At the time of this writing, alternative \nformats for the dissertation, or what some are calling a dissertation-in-practice (DiP) are being \nconsidered at San José State University. These alternatives model thematic dissertations, problem \nsolving dissertations, narrative inquiries, as well as the traditional dissertation formats. Regardless of \napproach or format, the dissertation is expected to contribute to an improvement to education \npractice and/or education policy in the context of a particular education institution. It is expected that \nthe dissertation show evidence of originality, critical and independent thinking, appropriate form and \norganization, and a rationale for the examined research problem.\nStudents interested in pursuing non-traditional models of dissertation research including\ndissertations-in-practice (DiP), action research, creative projects, joint or group research projects, \nand other research formats are encouraged to talk their ideas through with their chair/committee. It \nis incumbent on the student (with input from the doctoral committee chair) to make explicit the road \nmap which the project will follow and to outline the evaluative criteria to be used at the project’s \ncompletion.\nThe Dissertation Committee consists of three members, one whom serves as the committee chair. \nTwo members of the dissertation committee are expected to be tenured or tenure-track members \nof the San José State University Faculty (chair + one other). The chair is expected to be a core or an \nafﬁliated faculty member of the Ed.D. program at SJSU. The third member of the committee is \nexpected to be employed or previously employed at a local school or school district or at an\ninstitution of higher education, having achieved the terminal degree (e.g., Ed.D., Ph.D.). The student \nand chair typically consult with each other on appropriate committee members and invite the other \ntwo committee members to participate. The dissertation chair may call meetings at any time to \ncheck the candidate's progress. The most important meetings are the proposal defense, where the \nproposal is presented to the committee for approval, and the ﬁnal oral defense where the completed \ndissertation is presented to the committee and other interested faculty and/or and students. \nCommittee membership is conﬁrmed by form and submitted to the Ed.D. Program Director.\nAfter completing the dissertation proposal defense and IRB approval, the student carries out the \nresearch plan described in the approved proposal, collects and analyzes data, and continues writing \nthe dissertation. The student's Chair and Dissertation Committee guide the student to ensure the \ndissertation is a scholarly work resulting from research study and that contributes to the \nimprovement of educational practice.\nThe student works with the committee chair to develop a system for reviewing drafts and for sharing \ndrafts with other committee members at appropriate times. The student is expected to submit drafts \nof the dissertation to committee members in appropriately word-processed form. The completed \nﬁnal draft also includes the abstract, copyright page, title page, acknowledgments, table of contents, \nlist of tables and ﬁgures, references, and appendices.

DISSERTATION \nAfter the dissertation proposal and IRB are approved, the doctoral student is permitted to begin \ncollecting data proposed in the dissertation proposal. All students must enroll in a total of 12 units of \ndissertation credit during the ﬁnal year of the program — 6 credits in fall semester and 6 credits in the \nspring semester of year 3 of the program. Once the candidate has enrolled in 12 dissertation units, \nthe maximum allowable, continuous enrollment must be maintained until the dissertation is approved \nand ﬁled.  \nDescription of the Dissertation \nThe traditional dissertation consists of ﬁve chapters or sections: 1) introduction, 2) literature review, \n3) methodology, 4) results/analysis, and 5) conclusions/recommendations. This is typically followed \nby a references section and relevant appendices. The Lurie College of Education uses APA style for \nresearch and the SJSU Graduate Studies division provides additional formatting/style guidelines for \ntheses and dissertations.  \nThere are currently many initiatives across the country which reference new strategies and \napproaches for the doctoral dissertation in the Ed.D. program. At the time of this writing, alternative \nformats for the dissertation, or what some are calling a dissertation-in-practice (DiP) are being \nconsidered at San José State University. These alternatives model thematic dissertations, problem \nsolving dissertations, narrative inquiries, as well as the traditional dissertation formats. Regardless of \napproach or format, the dissertation is expected to contribute to an improvement to education \npractice and/or education policy in the context of a particular education institution. It is expected that \nthe dissertation show evidence of originality, critical and independent thinking, appropriate form and \norganization, and a rationale for the examined research problem.\nStudents interested in pursuing non-traditional models of dissertation research including\ndissertations-in-practice (DiP), action research, creative projects, joint or group research projects, \nand other research formats are encouraged to talk their ideas through with their chair/committee. It \nis incumbent on the student (with input from the doctoral committee chair) to make explicit the road \nmap which the project will follow and to outline the evaluative criteria to be used at the project’s \ncompletion.\nThe Dissertation Committee consists of three members, one whom serves as the committee chair. \nTwo members of the dissertation committee are expected to be tenured or tenure-track members \nof the San José State University Faculty (chair + one other). The chair is expected to be a core or an \nafﬁliated faculty member of the Ed.D. program at SJSU. The third member of the committee is \nexpected to be employed or previously employed at a local school or school district or at an\ninstitution of higher education, having achieved the terminal degree (e.g., Ed.D., Ph.D.). The student \nand chair typically consult with each other on appropriate committee members and invite the other \ntwo committee members to participate. The dissertation chair may call meetings at any time to \ncheck the candidate's progress. The most important meetings are the proposal defense, where the \nproposal is presented to the committee for approval, and the ﬁnal oral defense where the completed \ndissertation is presented to the committee and other interested faculty and/or and students. \nCommittee membership is conﬁrmed by form and submitted to the Ed.D. Program Director.\nAfter completing the dissertation proposal defense and IRB approval, the student carries out the \nresearch plan described in the approved proposal, collects and analyzes data, and continues writing \nthe dissertation. The student's Chair and Dissertation Committee guide the student to ensure the \ndissertation is a scholarly work resulting from research study and that contributes to the \nimprovement of educational practice.\nThe student works with the committee chair to develop a system for reviewing drafts and for sharing \ndrafts with other committee members at appropriate times. The student is expected to submit drafts \nof the dissertation to committee members in appropriately word-processed form. The completed \nﬁnal draft also includes the abstract, copyright page, title page, acknowledgments, table of contents, \nlist of tables and ﬁgures, references, and appendices. The student submits the ﬁnal draft manuscript \nto committee members for a ﬁnal reading and approval.

As deemed \nappropriate by the program faculty, a rubric may be used to judge proﬁciency of these defenses.\n3. DISSERTATION \nAfter the dissertation proposal and IRB are approved, the doctoral student is permitted to begin \ncollecting data proposed in the dissertation proposal. All students must enroll in a total of 12 units of \ndissertation credit during the ﬁnal year of the program — 6 credits in fall semester and 6 credits in the \nspring semester of year 3 of the program. Once the candidate has enrolled in 12 dissertation units, \nthe maximum allowable, continuous enrollment must be maintained until the dissertation is approved \nand ﬁled.  \nDescription of the Dissertation \nThe traditional dissertation consists of ﬁve chapters or sections: 1) introduction, 2) literature review, \n3) methodology, 4) results/analysis, and 5) conclusions/recommendations. This is typically followed \nby a references section and relevant appendices. The Lurie College of Education uses APA style for \nresearch and the SJSU Graduate Studies division provides additional formatting/style guidelines for \ntheses and dissertations.  \nThere are currently many initiatives across the country which reference new strategies and \napproaches for the doctoral dissertation in the Ed.D. program. At the time of this writing, alternative \nformats for the dissertation, or what some are calling a dissertation-in-practice (DiP) are being \nconsidered at San José State University. These alternatives model thematic dissertations, problem \nsolving dissertations, narrative inquiries, as well as the traditional dissertation formats. Regardless of \napproach or format, the dissertation is expected to contribute to an improvement to education \npractice and/or education policy in the context of a particular education institution. It is expected that \nthe dissertation show evidence of originality, critical and independent thinking, appropriate form and \norganization, and a rationale for the examined research problem.\nStudents interested in pursuing non-traditional models of dissertation research including\ndissertations-in-practice (DiP), action research, creative projects, joint or group research projects, \nand other research formats are encouraged to talk their ideas through with their chair/committee. It \nis incumbent on the student (with input from the doctoral committee chair) to make explicit the road \nmap which the project will follow and to outline the evaluative criteria to be used at the project’s \ncompletion.\nThe Dissertation Committee consists of three members, one whom serves as the committee chair. \nTwo members of the dissertation committee are expected to be tenured or tenure-track members \nof the San José State University Faculty (chair + one other). The chair is expected to be a core or an \nafﬁliated faculty member of the Ed.D. program at SJSU. The third member of the committee is \nexpected to be employed or previously employed at a local school or school district or at an\ninstitution of higher education, having achieved the terminal degree (e.g., Ed.D., Ph.D.). The student \nand chair typically consult with each other on appropriate committee members and invite the other \ntwo committee members to participate. The dissertation chair may call meetings at any time to \ncheck the candidate's progress. The most important meetings are the proposal defense, where the \nproposal is presented to the committee for approval, and the ﬁnal oral defense where the completed \ndissertation is presented to the committee and other interested faculty and/or and students. \nCommittee membership is conﬁrmed by form and submitted to the Ed.D. Program Director.\nAfter completing the dissertation proposal defense and IRB approval, the student carries out the \nresearch plan described in the approved proposal, collects and analyzes data, and continues writing \nthe dissertation. The student's Chair and Dissertation Committee guide the student to ensure the \ndissertation is a scholarly work resulting from research study and that contributes to the \nimprovement of educational practice.\nThe student works with the committee chair to develop a system for reviewing drafts and for sharing \ndrafts with other committee members at appropriate times. The student is expected to submit drafts \nof the dissertation to committee members in appropriately word-processed form. The completed \nﬁnal draft also includes the abstract, copyright page, title page, acknowledgments, table of contents, \nlist of tables and ﬁgures, references, and appendices. The student submits the ﬁnal draft manuscript \nto committee members for a ﬁnal reading and approval. The ﬁnal dissertation may take a variety of \n7"", ""research methodology, theoretical constructs, and critical and creative thinking. As deemed \nappropriate by the program faculty, a rubric may be used to judge proﬁciency of these defenses.\n3. DISSERTATION \nAfter the dissertation proposal and IRB are approved, the doctoral student is permitted to begin \ncollecting data proposed in the dissertation proposal. All students must enroll in a total of 12 units of \ndissertation credit during the ﬁnal year of the program — 6 credits in fall semester and 6 credits in the \nspring semester of year 3 of the program. Once the candidate has enrolled in 12 dissertation units, \nthe maximum allowable, continuous enrollment must be maintained until the dissertation is approved \nand ﬁled.  \nDescription of the Dissertation \nThe traditional dissertation consists of ﬁve chapters or sections: 1) introduction, 2) literature review, \n3) methodology, 4) results/analysis, and 5) conclusions/recommendations. This is typically followed \nby a references section and relevant appendices. The Lurie College of Education uses APA style for \nresearch and the SJSU Graduate Studies division provides additional formatting/style guidelines for \ntheses and dissertations.  \nThere are currently many initiatives across the country which reference new strategies and \napproaches for the doctoral dissertation in the Ed.D. program. At the time of this writing, alternative \nformats for the dissertation, or what some are calling a dissertation-in-practice (DiP) are being \nconsidered at San José State University. These alternatives model thematic dissertations, problem \nsolving dissertations, narrative inquiries, as well as the traditional dissertation formats. Regardless of \napproach or format, the dissertation is expected to contribute to an improvement to education \npractice and/or education policy in the context of a particular education institution. It is expected that \nthe dissertation show evidence of originality, critical and independent thinking, appropriate form and \norganization, and a rationale for the examined research problem.\nStudents interested in pursuing non-traditional models of dissertation research including\ndissertations-in-practice (DiP), action research, creative projects, joint or group research projects, \nand other research formats are encouraged to talk their ideas through with their chair/committee. It \nis incumbent on the student (with input from the doctoral committee chair) to make explicit the road \nmap which the project will follow and to outline the evaluative criteria to be used at the project’s \ncompletion.\nThe Dissertation Committee consists of three members, one whom serves as the committee chair. \nTwo members of the dissertation committee are expected to be tenured or tenure-track members \nof the San José State University Faculty (chair + one other). The chair is expected to be a core or an \nafﬁliated faculty member of the Ed.D. program at SJSU. The third member of the committee is \nexpected to be employed or previously employed at a local school or school district or at an\ninstitution of higher education, having achieved the terminal degree (e.g., Ed.D., Ph.D.). The student \nand chair typically consult with each other on appropriate committee members and invite the other \ntwo committee members to participate. The dissertation chair may call meetings at any time to \ncheck the candidate's progress. The most important meetings are the proposal defense, where the \nproposal is presented to the committee for approval, and the ﬁnal oral defense where the completed \ndissertation is presented to the committee and other interested faculty and/or and students. \nCommittee membership is conﬁrmed by form and submitted to the Ed.D. Program Director.\nAfter completing the dissertation proposal defense and IRB approval, the student carries out the \nresearch plan described in the approved proposal, collects and analyzes data, and continues writing \nthe dissertation. The student's Chair and Dissertation Committee guide the student to ensure the \ndissertation is a scholarly work resulting from research study and that contributes to the \nimprovement of educational practice.\nThe student works with the committee chair to develop a system for reviewing drafts and for sharing \ndrafts with other committee members at appropriate times. The student is expected to submit drafts \nof the dissertation to committee members in appropriately word-processed form. The completed \nﬁnal draft also includes the abstract, copyright page, title page, acknowledgments, table of contents, \nlist of tables and ﬁgures, references, and appendices. The student submits the ﬁnal draft manuscript \nto committee members for a ﬁnal reading and approval.
